## Santander Bank Menu Component

---

### Introduction

During my tenure at Santander Bank, I developed a dynamic menu component tailored to provide enhanced user interactivity. Designed with the end-user in mind, the component is both draggable and editable, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Features:

#### 1. **Draggable Elements**:
* Users can intuitively reposition menu items, optimizing their interface based on personal preferences.
* Provides an interactive way to prioritize frequently used features.

#### 2. **Editable Menu Items**:
* Edit the names of menu items directly within the UI.
* Allows users to customize naming conventions to their liking.

#### 3. **Coded in Kotlin**:
* Leveraging Kotlin's concise syntax and interoperability, ensuring a robust and efficient performance.
* Benefits from Kotlin's safety features, such as null safety, to guarantee a crash-free user experience.

### Integration:

For developers looking to integrate or modify the component, the Kotlin-based design ensures ease of compatibility with Android platforms and other Kotlin-based systems. A comprehensive API documentation and integration guide accompany the component to streamline the integration process.

### Key Achievements:

* Successfully implemented and rolled out in Santander Bank's main app, enhancing user customization and overall satisfaction.
* Achieved a reduction in menu-related user queries post-implementation, indicating an intuitive design.
* Regularly updated to ensure compatibility with the latest Kotlin versions and mobile OS updates.
